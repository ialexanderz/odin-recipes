      <p>The Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster is an alcoholic beverage invented by ex-President of the Galaxy Zaphod Beeblebrox, considered by the Guide to be the "Best Drink in Existence." Its effects are similar to "having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick."</p>
      <p>Beeblebrox advised that you should "never drink more than two Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters unless you are a thirty ton mega elephant with bronchial pneumonia." However, Ford Prefect ignored this advice and consumed three Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters while at Milliways.</p>

      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Take the juice from one bottle of Ol' Janx Spirit.</li>
        <li>Pour into it one measure of water from the seas of Santraginus V â€” Oh, that Santraginean seawater! Oh, those Santraginean fish!<li>
        <li>Allow three cubes of Arcturan Mega-gin to melt into the mixture (it must be properly iced or the benzene is lost).</li>
        <li>Allow four litres of Fallian marsh gas to bubble through it, in memory of all those happy hikers who have died of pleasure in the Marshes of Fallia</li>
        <li>Over the back of a silver spoon float a measure of Qualactin Hypermint extract, redolent of all the heady odours of the dark Qualactin Zones, subtle, sweet and mystic.</li>
        <li>Drop in the tooth of an Algolian Suntiger. Watch it dissolve, spreading the fires of the Algolian Suns deep into the heart of the drink.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle Zamphuor.</li>
        <li>Add an olive.</li>
        <li>Drink... but... very carefully...</li>
